# Pyber_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis

The company V. Isualize has that I create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I'll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. They are interested in seeing how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

## Summary
